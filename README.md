### Objective: The goal of the project was to create a staffing plan for temporary medical employees supplied to hospitals and clinics in the U.S during flu season. The staffing agency required analysis of demographic data to identify vulnerable populations and recommend decisions about where and when to send members of their limited staffing pool. The goal of the plan is to employ all available staff and  minimize understaffing across states.
### Context: The project was part of the Career Foundry curriculum to demonstrate mastery of Tableau storyboard visualization techniques and data cleaning, organizing, and analyzing in Excel.
